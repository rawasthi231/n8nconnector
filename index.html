    <h1>Privacy Policy for N8NConnector</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: <time datetime="2025-08-26">August 26, 2025</time></em></p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy applies specifically to the Alexa skill named <strong>N8NConnector</strong> ("Skill") owned and operated by <strong>Raghvendra Awasthi</strong>. It explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use the Skill. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not enable or use the Skill.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Why We Collect Data</h2>
    <p>
      We collect user data (such as the text of your request, session metadata, and an anonymous Alexa user identifier) to process your natural language question, run the requested task (e.g., a RAG search or email workflow), and return a response. We do not collect audio recordings—voice-to-text conversion is handled entirely by Amazon Alexa services.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data We May Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Request intent name and slots (e.g., your question or command).</li>
      <li>System metadata, such as <code>job_id</code> during asynchronous tasks, and the utterance text used for processing.</li>
      <li>Temporary job results for follow-up responses (deleted typically within 24–72 hours).</li>
      <li>Application logs (timestamps, request IDs, error messages) for debugging. These may include your IP address in server logs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To fulfill your request (e.g., search a vector database, generate summaries).</li>
      <li>To manage long-running workflows asynchronously.</li>
      <li>To improve system reliability and safety (e.g., logging, analytics).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We share your data only with trusted service providers required for our Skill’s functionality:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Amazon Alexa services for voice invocation.</li>
      <li>Our backend infrastructure (hosted on AWS or similar).</li>
      <li>Qdrant or similar vector stores for retrieval-based tasks.</li>
      <li>LLM providers (e.g., Google Gemini) for processing your queries.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Workflow-related data stored temporarily (e.g., job results remain ~24–72 hours).</li>
      <li>Server logs are retained up to ~30 days for debugging and security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard security practices—HTTPS in transit, strict access controls, and encrypted storage where applicable.</p>

    <h2>7. Children</h2>
    <p><strong>This Skill is not intended for use by children under 13.</strong></p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
